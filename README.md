Open Source code for Independent Film Financing through ICOs.

INTRODUCTION

Independent film is a wide definition. Anything outside of the "studio" system can be classified as an indie film but usually budget determines if a film is truly independent. For purposes of this project, we'll use SAG AFTRA classifications for "Low Budget" or LP (under $2.5 Million, "Modfied Low Budget" or MLB (under $700k) or "Ultra Low Budget"  or ULB (under $250k).

(1) NEARLY ALL FIRST TIME INDIE FILMMAKERS WILL MAKE UNPROFITABLE FILMS

Purely anectodal, but the reality is that when someone sets out to make their first narrative feature, the entire investment is at risk. Every once in a while, lightning strikes and a small and personal indie film breaks out and everyone looks like a financial genius. But for the most part, the odds are very long and the return is very little. However, making an indie feature shows how a filmmaker can create a viable piece of content with limited resources. 

For example, Christopher Nolan's first narrative feature film was "Following" (1998). It as a a 69 minute B&W film that was seen in film festivals but by most accounts was not profitable at the outset. But as Nolan's career progressed and skyrocketed (Memento, The Dark Knight Trilogy, Interstellar, Dunkirk), there became much interest in his first film. As a result, this film has been licensed and sold and is available on streaming services such as Amazon Video. His initial $6,000 investment has been very profitable in the long run. But his first film was made to get his second film made.

(2) FIRST FILMS ARE USUALLY SELF FINANCED, BOOTSTRAPPED, OR CROWDSOURCED

It is a time honored tradition that a first time filmmaker will overturn every rock looking for money to make a film. Savings accounts are drained, second mortgages are taken out, friends and family are hit up, or a filmmaker will monetize social media and ask for money through sites like Kickstarter or IndieGoGo. Accounting is very loose and those that "invest" in a film are really at the mercy of the filmmaker if any equity and/or profits are not returned. Most people that give money to a film are doing so to help a friend or acquaintence or perhaps the message of the film is something they support.

If a filmmaker raises money through Kickstarter or IndieGoGo, they have to pay fees, credit card processing charges and eventually fullfillment costs for donation incentives. A filmmaker will lose about 20% of the capital raised through these sources. It does help create interest and a community but often film projects stall or take so long to complete that people lose touch after making their contribution.

(3) RAISING MONEY THROUGH AN ICO, CONSIDER IT A TOTAL LOSS, BUT MAYBE THERE'S AN UPSIDE POTENTIAL

What if a filmmaker could raise money for a film through an Initial Coin Offering with the understading to investors that as an investment, this is highly risky and that any returns would be unlikely. But in case the filmmaker strikes gold, then those that took the leap would be rewarded? By implenting an ICO as an ERC20 token on Ethereum (with an eye on NEO when that becomes popular), then there are those that are out there that might be willing to invest in a film with the prospect of prestige and bragging rights for backing a young filmmaker who goes onto greater glory.
